Infant language acquisition is an efficient process that has been studied by linguists and psychologists for decades. While we still donâ€™t fully understand yet how an infant can learn a language simply by listening to the environment around them, the most prominent theory proposed to explain the phenomenon so far is the statistical learning model. 

The statistical learning model for infant language acquisition theorizes that children obtain lexical, grammatical and even phonological knowledge about a certain language by extracting statistical regularities from any input stream of words. The most well-observed one out of those is the learning in lexical acquisition; while spoken language does not have clear boundaries between words, infants can statistically find patterns of certain phonemes that repeatedly occur across different utterances to figure out the individual words making up the lexicon. For example, consider the given two grammatically acceptable sentences: This is a dog and This was a lemon. While the two sets of three morphemes is-a-dog, was-a-lemon would be pronounced without any breaks in the middle, the child can statistically realize that a is the repeatedly occurring component, and thus conclude that it is a single word. For this project, we aim to replicate such lexical statistical learning given a set of speech audio inputs by incorporating AI principles learned in class.
